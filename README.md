# WCD_BIG_DATA_PROJECT
## Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project leverages **big data platforms** such as **Databricks** and **AWS** to perform **sentiment analysis** of tweets and extract insights.

The tweets were extracted from the public S3 bucket of WeCloudData. Since they were not labeled, **TextBlob** was used to generate sentiment labels. The sentiment analysis was conducted using **PySpark** , and the results were exported to my personal S3 bucket. From there, **Amazon Athena** was used to run queries, and finally, a dashboard was created on **QuickSight** to gain insights from the analysis.


Skills/Tools: NLP, sentiment analysis, TextBlob, PySpark, AWS (EC2, S3, Amazon Athena, Quicksight), Machine Learning, Pipeline,
